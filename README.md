# ImageParsingSys
* This is an ImageParsingSystem   
I study in SJTU while I do my research on remote server in Beijing.    
However, I have no authority of the remote server.   
Thus, this web App is developed for converting screenshots of remote server to a text on local PC.    
* This web App is easily operated,   
after open the homepage,   
you only need to upload the images,   
then, results will show on the same page.  
* A sample:
